Program Analysis Summary
======
This is a summary of the course material of Prof. Vechevs Program Analysis Course at ETH Zurich, spring 2015. 

Attention
----
I created this summary to force me to go through the course material. This summary is not proof read and probably contains a couple of errors (spelling and conceptually).
Use with caution.

The graphics were taken from the course material (which is avaiable [here](http://www.srl.inf.ethz.ch/pa.php)). The text is sometimes my own wording and other times directly copied from the lecture.
